Installation Guide
-------------------

### System Requirements


* Windows 7 or higher
* .NET Framework 4.5 or higher (the installer will automatically get one if you don't have it.)

### Instructions

1. Get the latest version of Journaley from the [releases page](https://github.com/yyoon/Journaley/releases).
2. Execute the downloaded installer.  
   *NOTE: If you have Journaley 1.x, please uninstall it before installing the latest version.*
3. The installer will launch the Journaley app automatically.  
   You can also find a shortcut under Start Menu -> Programs -> Journaley.
4. When you run Journaley for the first time, you will see the welcome screen.
   If you already have a journal database created by *Journaley* or *Day One*, select "**Import Your Journal.**"
   Otherwise, select "**Start a New Journal.**"  
   If you import the *Day One* database from Dropbox, it will automatically be in sync with Journaley.
5. You can optionally set a password to access your journal entries through Journaley.
6. After the initial setup, you will see your existing journal entries (if there's any), or an empty journal.  
   You can add new entries or edit existing ones from now on.
